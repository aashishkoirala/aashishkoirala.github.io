Seriously, though, when I was working on <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/finance-manager/>Finance Manager</a>, I realized I made a few mistakes, specifically with the way I was doing Angular as well as building a REST API. I therefore wanted to build something simpler- yet something that I would personally use, and in the process try to do it &ldquo;more right&rdquo; and learn something in the process as well. I think two of the key new things I learned building this application was <a href=http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute.$route>routing</a> with Angular and working with <a href=http://www.mongodb.org/>MongoDB</a>. I ended up building a <a href=https://www.nuget.org/packages/AK.Commons.Providers.DataAccess.MongoDb>Mongo provider</a> for the <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-commons-library/>Commons Library</a> as well. I also think this servers as a better example of how to marry TypeScript with Angular.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</p><p><img src=/blog-images/yes-one-more-to-do-application-screenshot.png alt=Screenshot></p><p>I had my complaints about <a href=http://www.astrid.com/>Astrid</a>, but was getting used to it when it got yanked out of existence all of a sudden by Yahoo (good for them, though). Rather than trying to go and look for something else that worked for me, I decided to build it and learn something in the process as well (which sits well with my thoughts on when to roll your own as a developer - probably a post on that soon to follow). With this application I can create nested categories, create tasks within those categories, give them due dates and start dates - and walk them through a work-flow of created, started, in progress and done (or just created and done - depending on what kind of task it is). Two features I really like that I missed in Astrid is the ability to bulk import tasks from plain text - and the ability to perform bulk actions.</p><p>This time, I also made sure I could actually deploy it to the cloud once I was done with it. It is deployed here, using <a href=https://appharbor.com/>AppHarbor</a>. Since I&rsquo;m too cheap to want to pay for a To Do application, I&rsquo;m using the free instance. I intend to use this for my own personal use, but if you plan to use it - be aware that this is a free, development instance and could disappear tomorrow. I would love it, however, if you wanted to look around and offer me feedback.</p><p>Again, the application is deployed <a href=http://todo-17.apphb.com>here</a>, and the source code can be found <a href=http://github.com/aashishkoirala/todo>here</a>. More technical details can be found <a href=http://aashishkoirala.github.io/todo/>here</a>.</p><p>Other than the obvious gaps to fill (as marked by the many &ldquo;TODO"s in the source code), one thing I definitely want to do at some point is build a mobile front-end to this - and also make the web UI use responsive layout (if you open the web application in a phone, it looks really messed up). Then there is always that colossal task of going back and fixing mistakes I made with <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/finance-manager/>Finance Manager</a>.</p><div style=font-size:smaller><br><br>Tags:
