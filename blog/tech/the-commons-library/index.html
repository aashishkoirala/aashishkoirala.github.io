The idea is you have something of your own that handles (or at least provides a way to handle) common cross-cutting concerns in all applications that you build. This includes areas such as configuration, logging, security, error handling, data access, dependency injection and caching to name a few. As long as it is kept up to date, it is also a good way to keep up to date with new technologies in these areas. My last attempt at a commons library was during my .NET 2 days - and it worked pretty well for applications that I built back then. I realized recently that I hadn&rsquo;t really kept it up to date and as a result was not using it. So, I decided to scrap it and build something from scratch that would take advantage of the latest and the greatest that&rsquo;s out there (that being .NET 4.5 as of now).</p><p>One of my key goals was to make the library itself more of a set of contracts, without any dependencies - so that I did not marry myself to any specific technology. Instead, the library would just provide a way for consuming applications to do certain things. I could then build providers that implement these contracts and use various technologies to get the job done. This way, as new technologies emerge, I can incorporate them into my applications by building and hooking up new providers while everything else remains the same. I decided to use MEF as the mechanism to do this - and it also serves as a good dependency injection provider.</p><p>The library is called <strong>AK.Commons</strong> and with its first release is very much in its infancy. It gets the job done for what I need to do today - but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I will need to add to it quite a bit as I go along. This time around, to make sure I stay engaged in maintaining this (and possibly to gather input and feedback from the community), I have decided to release it on <a href=http://www.nuget.org/packages/ak.commons/>Nuget</a>, open source the code on <a href=http://github.com/aashishkoirala/commons/>GitHub</a>, and also put up some <a href=http://aashishkoirala.github.io/commons/>documentation</a>.</p><p>Over the next few days, I intend to blog some more about the library- particularly my thought process around each concern that the library supports, along with details on some of the providers, my applications that actually use this - and also my plans for the library for the future- a roadmap if you will. Usage and forks of the library and feedback on it is welcome and much appreciated.</p><div style=font-size:smaller><br><br>Tags:
