I believe the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215>definitive book</a> on it by <strong>Eric Evans</strong> came out first in 2004. For whatever reason, I had not been exposed to it in places I worked. I had been hearing about it for enough time and from enough smart people to give it a try. I researched it online a bit and went through quite a few articles. Especially, the set of articles on DDD by <a href=https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/>Jimmy Bogard</a> (Los Techies) was quite helpful. Finally, I ended up buying Evans&rsquo; book and reading it cover to cover.</p><p>I liked what I saw. The whole idea behind keeping your domain logic encapsulated within your domain objects appealed to me. There were questions, obviously, but I figured it was worth trying out. So that is what I am deep into currently. The idea of entities, value objects, aggregates and aggregate roots makes sense, but at the same time, also raises questions - especially with regards to database performance. I am hoping I will arrive at satisfactory answers.</p><p>As things get more complex, other concepts such as bounded contexts and domain events enter the picture. While I get them in theory, my idea for now is to stay away from actually getting hands-on with those until I have a good handle on &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; DDD. Another question I have is how this meshes with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture>SOA</a> - whether the two are complimentary or exclusive. I would hate to have to give up SOA to stick with DDD. In any case, it feels exciting - and I can&rsquo;t believe it has been around for so many years and I never got into it.</p><p>For anyone getting into DDD, I strongly recommend reading Evans&rsquo; book. In software timescale, it was written aeons ago (when Java was the state-of-the-art, mind you). But all of it still applies, and if you&rsquo;re working with something like C#, as I am, things become even easier since you have so much more power with these modern languages.</p><p>So, for the moment, let&rsquo;s say I am on the bandwagon. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t have to get off.</p><div style=font-size:smaller><br><br>Tags:
