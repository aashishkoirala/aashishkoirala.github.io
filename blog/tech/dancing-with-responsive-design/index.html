CSS3 is obviously quite powerful and media queries provide a relatively easy way to build one unified UI that looks great on PCs, but then adapts and shape-shifts accordingly when viewed on a smartphone or tablet without having to completely re-implement a &ldquo;mobile site&rdquo; as so many do today. Since UI design is not my core area, though, I never could quite gather the energy to do something with it. Then I saw support for responsiveness in the new <a href=http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities>Bootstrap 3</a>. Like with all other aspects of web UI design, it makes responsiveness that much easier as well. As added motivation, I tried out my <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/yes-one-more-to-do-application/>To Do</a> application in my smartphone - and it looked awful.</p><p>In the spirit of <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/on-rolling-your-own/>rolling my own</a>, my next application I wanted to build for myself was a simple list maker that I could use for groceries, shopping, and other checklists. Since something like that would find its best use across multiple types of devices (and since I am not quite ready to jump into native mobile development just yet), it seemed like the perfect opportunity to try out responsive design with Bootstrap. After getting over a slight upgrade shock after switching from Bootstrap 2.3 to 3 (helped quite a bit by <a href=http://www.sitepoint.com/whats-new-bootstrap-3/>this post here</a>), things became quite easy.</p><p>The end result is my new application, so very imaginatively titled <strong>My Lists</strong>- deployed <a href=http://mylists.apphb.com>here</a> (again, be aware that this is a development instance), and open sourced <a href=http://github.com/aashishkoirala/mylists/>here</a>. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like in PCs and in tablets in landscape:</p><p><img src=http://mylists.apphb.com/Content/images/screenshot-big.png alt=Screenshot></p><p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like in a smartphone:</p><p><img src=http://mylists.apphb.com/Content/images/screenshot-small.png alt=Screenshot></p><p>Rest of the technology is pretty much the same as <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/yes-one-more-to-do-application/>To Do</a>- .NET REST API, AngularJS and MongoDB.</p><p>Responsive design takes a little getting used to, but I think is quite worth it.</p><div style=font-size:smaller><br><br>Tags:
