You can write a simple <code>Main()</code> method and do your stuff, but how do you get the advantage of the amazing configuration and dependency injection that you get out of the box with hosted apps? Surely, you could set up all that machinery and maybe create an <code>IHostedService</code> implementation just to get going.

If you are targetting developers with the .NET Core SDK installed on their machines and need to ship CLI tools, your job is made immensely easier. It is just as easy as shipping a NuGet package. However, once you get used to building these things, it is easy to fall into the trap of treating this shipping mechanism as if it were <a href=https://chocolatey.org/>Chocolatey</a> (or <em>apt-get</em>, or <em>yum</em>, or what-have-you). It is certainly not that. The process of installing and upgrading your tools are handled by the .NET Core SDK - which alleviates you from having to create a self-contained package if you were shipping a ready-to-go tool - and this makes sense - global tools are a developer-targetted thing.

Microservices and containers are quite the hype these days. With hype comes misinformation and hysteria. A lot of people conflate the two (fortunately there are <a href=https://jimmybogard.com/my-microservices-faq/>wise people out there</a> to set us all straight). If you have done your due diligence and decided to go with microservices, you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to go with containers. In fact, one would argue that using containers for production might be a good crutch for applications that have too many tentacles and there is no appetite to port them or rewrite them to be &ldquo;portable&rdquo;. Containers do have <a href=https://jimmybogard.com/containers-what-is-it-good-for/>other good use cases</a> too. Docker being the leading container format (although starting to face some competition from <a href=https://coreos.com/rkt/>rkt</a> these days), all in all I am glad containers exist and I am glad that Docker exists. Just be aware of the fact that what you think you must use may not be what you need at all.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/on-service-fabric-kubernetes-and-docker/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/reader-writer-locking-with-async-await/>Reader-Writer Locking with Async-Await</a></h1><time datetime=2017-12-20T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Wed, Dec 20, 2017</time><p>Consider this another pitfall warning. If you are a frequent user of <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/reader-writer-locking-in-dotnet/>reader/writer locking</a> (via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim?view=netframework-4.7.2"><code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code></a> class) like I am, you will undoubtedly run into this situation. As more and more code we write these days are asynchronous with the use of <code>async/await</code>, it is easy to end up in the following situation (an oversimplification, but just imagine write locks in there as well):</p><pre><code>async Task MyMethod()
{
	...
	myReaderWriterLockSlim.EnterReadLock();
	var thing = await ReadThingAsync();
	... 
	myReaderWriterLockSlim.ExitReadLock(); // This guy will choke.
}
</code></pre><p>This, of course, will not work. This is because reader/writer locks, at least the implementation in .NET, are <em>thread-affine</em>. This means the very same thread that acquired a lock must be the one to release it. As soon as you hit an <code>await</code>, you have dispatched the rest of the behavior to some other thread. So this cannot work.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/reader-writer-locking-with-async-await/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/listor-showcasing-react-and-dotnet-core/>Listor- Showcasing React and .NET Core</a></h1><time datetime=2017-11-20T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Mon, Nov 20, 2017</time><p>For both <a href=https://reactjs.org/>React</a> and for <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/>.NET Core</a> (specifically <a href=https://www.asp.net/core/overview/aspnet-vnext>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/>Entity Framework Core</a>), I got sick of playing around with little prototypes and decided to build an application. <a href=https://github.com/aashishkoirala/listor>Listor</a> is my first proper application I have built using both these technologies.

While I still shy away from going completely functional for full-blown applications, I try to use the tenets of functional programming as much as I can even when writing C#. This is made much easier by the fact that C# has borrowed a lot of functional programming features as it has evolved. With each new version of the language, I find my code getting more concise and more expressive mostly owing to these features. That said, if you are looking for a functional-first experience, nothing beats a functional language. I like <strong>F#</strong> as it belongs to the .NET ecosystem but is derived from <strong>OCaml</strong> which itself is quite elegant.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/fiddling-with-fsharp/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/writing-a-ws-federation-based-sts-using-wif/>Writing a WS-Federation Based STS using WIF</a></h1><time datetime=2015-02-10T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Tue, Feb 10, 2015</time><p>Even though <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language>SAML</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Security>WS-*</a> have started to be looked upon as the old guard of security protocols with the popularity of <a href=http://oauth.net/2/>OAuth 2</a>, they are not without their merits. For one, they are <a href=https://hueniverse.com/2012/07/26/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/>inherently more secure than OAuth</a> (in fact, you need to rely on a separate underlying secure transport for OAuth to be considered secure- and if you are someone who believes <a href=http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-the-nsa-and-your-boss-can-intercept-and-break-ssl/>SSL is broken</a>, then OAuth is practically insecure). It just so happens that their demerits are very visible to someone trying to implement or integrate them.

It will then be followed by a whole bunch of commits that are advancements of or adjustments to that - quick and dirty ones with &ldquo;WIP (i.e. work in progress) as the message. If, in the middle of this, I switch to some other significant area, then I will add another commit with a more verbose message, and then again it&rsquo;s &ldquo;WIP, &ldquo;WIP, and so on. I will add any thing I need to qualify the &ldquo;WIP with if necessary (e.g. if the &ldquo;WIP is for a different context than the last few WIPs, or if the WIP does indeed add some more information to the initial commit). In any case, after some time, I will end up with a history that looks a bit like this (in chronological order):</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/git-rewriter-of-history/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/beware-of-this-wcf-serialization-pitfall/>Beware of this WCF Serialization Pitfall</a></h1><time datetime=2014-12-02T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Tue, Dec 2, 2014</time><p>Ideally, one should avoid data contracts with complex graphs- especially with repeated references and definitely ones with circular references.

There are some issues with his approach, though that Jimmy Bogard raises and addresses in <a href=https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/05/13/a-better-domain-events-pattern/>his post</a>. However, I was left with two questions:</p><ol><li>Shouldn&rsquo;t the domain event be dispatched/handled only when the transaction or the unit-of-work commits? Because whatever changes have been made to the state of the domain isn&rsquo;t really permanent until that happens.</li><li>There may be cases when domain events need to trigger changes to other domain objects in the same bounded context - and all of that needs to be persisted transactionally. In other words, in this scenario - it makes sense to have the event be dispatched just before the transaction commits. However, in this case, whatever ends up handling that event also needs access to the current transaction or unit-of-work that is in play - so that all the changes make it to persistence in one fell swoop of a commit.</li></ol><p>That leads me to conclude that there are really two types of domain events that need to be handled differently. The first type as listed above would either be infrastructure-y things like sending out e-mails and such, or sending messages to other bounded contexts or external systems. The second type would be within the same bounded context but maintain certain kinds of relations within the domain that could not be modeled within the same aggregate (simply put, they take the place of database triggers in the <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/getting-on-the-domain-driven-design-bandwagon/>DDD</a> metaphor).</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/two-types-of-domain-events/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/ddd-meet-soa/>DDD, meet SOA</a></h1><time datetime=2014-08-13T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Wed, Aug 13, 2014</time><p>There is a lot of discussion online around whether <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>DDD</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture>SOA</a> can co-exist, and if so, what that looks like.

A prudent way to decompose a system into services is to first identity what parts of the system is more likely to change more frequently. Thus, you decompose by volatility and set up dependencies such that you always have more volatile services calling less volatile services. Within the same level of volatility, of course, you would further decompose services by function if needed.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/a-method-for-service-oriented-architecture-soa/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/getting-on-the-domain-driven-design-bandwagon/>Getting on the Domain-Driven Design Bandwagon</a></h1><time datetime=2014-06-16T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Mon, Jun 16, 2014</time><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>Domain driven design</a> has been around for quite a while.

One of my pain points was the lack of object initializers that, in my opinion, took away some of the expressiveness of JavaScript.

Thus, you can and should be able to create an object or assign an object on the fly using JSON notation. As soon as you introduce TypeScript annotations into the mix, this goes away. The best of both worlds here would be if I could have it annotated and still be able to assign or initialize using JSON (and have the JSON be validated based on the annotation).</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/bye-bye-typescript-for-now/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/bootstrap-modal-with-angularjs/>Bootstrap Modal With AngularJS</a></h1><time datetime=2014-03-17T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Mon, Mar 17, 2014</time><p>We&rsquo;ll look at a relatively low hanging fruit in case you&rsquo;re working with vanilla AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and are not relying on other add-ons such as AngularUI&rsquo;s Bootstrap extension.

Most of the time, this is with good reason. If you are building a fairly complex system for a business and there is ROI at stake, it surely makes sense to at least assess what is readily available in the industry and is used and thus &ldquo;certified&rdquo; by the community for certain components before jumping in and building it oneself (however fun that may be). On the extreme end of this, you certainly don&rsquo;t want to roll your own operating system or database (unless that is at the core of what you&rsquo;re doing - in which case, of course, you do).</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/on-rolling-your-own/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/yes-one-more-to-do-application/>Yes, One More To-Do Application</a></h1><time datetime=2013-12-02T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Mon, Dec 2, 2013</time><blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE (2015/1/7)</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This application has been re-written from scratch using some new stuff I learned.

My philosophy therefore is to try to generate as much of these kinds of code as possible. With .NET, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Template_Transformation_Toolkit>T4</a> gives you a pretty neat code generation mechanism for generating code that follows a given pattern (the first example that comes to mind are POCOs from a domain model). If you think about it though, most multi-tier enterprise type applications have quite a bit of code that can be generated and that derives from the original domain model. How nice would it be to be able to generate a huge chunk of the codebase so that you only have to think about, write and <em>test</em> what you absolutely need to? I guess Entity Framework does some of it for you if you&rsquo;re into it. If you don&rsquo;t like the heavy-handedness of it (like me), you could opt for keeping your model as an EDMX file but then writing a bunch of T4 around it to generate various layers of code based on it.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/modeling-dsl-and-t4-ramblings/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/typescript-angularjs-and-bootstrap-the-killer-combo/>TypeScript, AngularJS and Bootstrap- The Killer Combo</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-30T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Fri, Aug 30, 2013</time><p>After having recently used this combination, I am in love with it.

The Commons Library, by itself, gives you a framework, some common functionality and a bunch of contracts. To get actual functionality out of it, providers need to be built that implement those contracts. The Commons Library does contain a bunch of built-in providers as well. These built-in providers are ones that do not have any third-party dependency other than the .NET framework and the most common of its extensions; the idea being I do not want to impose a whole bunch of dependencies on the Commons Library itself. Other than these built-in providers, I have built other providers that do have third party dependencies. These are individual libraries that are available as NuGet packages.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/providers-for-the-commons-library/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/data-access-in-the-commons-library/>Data Access in the Commons Library</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-25T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Sun, Aug 25, 2013</time><p>The data access block in the <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-commons-library/>Commons Library</a> is based on the <em>Unit of Work</em> and <em>Repository</em> patterns - or at least my take on them.</p><h4 id=unit-of-work>Unit of Work</h4><p>You start with a unit-of-work factory (which is an implementation if <code>IUnitOfWorkFactory</code>) and call <code>Create</code> on it to get an instance of <code>IUnitOfWork</code> which is also <code>IDisposable</code>. So, you get a unit-of-work and do your business inside a <code>using</code> block, and call <code>Commit</code> before you leave the block. Methods in <code>IUnitOfWork</code> are all based on working with a specific entity type (which is just a POCO with an identifier field) and uses LINQ and <code>IQueryable</code> - makes it easy to use as a consumer, but also makes it easy to implement providers as most providers worth their salt already have a LINQ interface. As of the time of this writing, I&rsquo;ve written two providers - one based on Fluent NHibernate and one based on MongoDB.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/data-access-in-the-commons-library/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/logging-in-the-commons-library/>Logging in the Commons Library</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-20T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Tue, Aug 20, 2013</time><p>My major goals when building the logging block for the <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-commons-library/>Commons Library</a> were to keep the logging interface simple (just tell me what level, I will give you the message to log - don&rsquo;t make me think too much), be able to log to multiple places (i.e. logging providers), and for the logging operation itself to be asynchronous (i.e. the only latency any logging should add is a memory operation).</p><p>With that, I believe what is now in place meets all of these. You get a MEF imported instance of <code>IAppLogger</code> which has simple <code>Info, Error, Warning, Verbose</code> methods that you can use to log messages or exceptions. Everything you log goes into a queue. When you initialize an application, a log queue thread is started which processes the queue, handles all common logging stuff (i.e. figure out what the configured logging level is and whether this entry should be logged at all based on that, construct a <code>LogEntry</code> object with all the information needed for each individual provider to do its thing, etc.), and dispatches the entry to all configured logging providers.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/logging-in-the-commons-library/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/configuration-in-the-commons-library/>Configuration in the Commons Library</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-15T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Thu, Aug 15, 2013</time><p>When working on the configuration block in the <a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-commons-library/>Commons Library</a>, I started out wanting to decouple the storage of configuration data and the format of that data from the actual configuration interface used by consumers to retrieve that data. I wanted consumers to be able to simply look up configuration data through a dictionary-style interface while the job of parsing the original format would be done by a configuration formatting provider and the job of getting that data from wherever would be done by a configuration store provider. Eventually, I settled on just following the .NET <code>System.Configuration</code> style XML format- as it is somewhat of a standard now, with a lot of other library builders also using it for their configuration needs. Besides, you diverge from this format and then you have to start rolling your own for tedious things like WCF configuration or diagnostics and tracing configuration - definitely a rat-hole I did not want to go down.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/configuration-in-the-commons-library/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/handling-duplicate-libraries-with-mef/>Handling Duplicate Libraries with MEF</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-09T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Fri, Aug 9, 2013</time><p>While building the composition/DI piece for the <a href=http://aashishkoirala.github.io/commons/>Commons Library</a>, one problem I ran into was the fact that if you told MEF to load assemblies from a number of different places - and they all had copies of the same library (which is possible especially with common dependencies), MEF would load the exports in each assembly as many times as it finds it.

The idea is you have something of your own that handles (or at least provides a way to handle) common cross-cutting concerns in all applications that you build. This includes areas such as configuration, logging, security, error handling, data access, dependency injection and caching to name a few. As long as it is kept up to date, it is also a good way to keep up to date with new technologies in these areas. My last attempt at a commons library was during my .NET 2 days - and it worked pretty well for applications that I built back then. I realized recently that I hadn&rsquo;t really kept it up to date and as a result was not using it. So, I decided to scrap it and build something from scratch that would take advantage of the latest and the greatest that&rsquo;s out there (that being .NET 4.5 as of now).</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/the-commons-library/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/introduction-to-nodejs/>Introduction to NodeJS</a></h1><time datetime=2012-04-12T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Thu, Apr 12, 2012</time><p>I just ran into some presentation material from a Node.js introduction presentation I had done in a session that shall remain unnamed.

This means that when you instantiate objects, the framework keeps track of how the object is being referenced, and automatically frees up memory used by the object when it is no longer referenced by anything and is “out of scope”. This works beautifully with objects that are part of the framework. In .NET lingo, these are called “managed resources”. However, a lot of times, a .NET or Java application needs to talk to other systems external to the framework – such as databases, file systems, network sockets, graphics engines, and so on – i.e. “unmanaged resources”. In such cases, it is up to the programmer to handle allocation and de-allocation of resources. Framework classes that provide access to such resources will usually provide routines to close or dispose of resources. However, the programmer still needs to write boilerplate in order to do it and the boilerplate usually becomes cumbersome when you take into account things like exception handling.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/tech/automatic-resource-management-in-csharp/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/pass-summit-2011-notes/>PASS Summit 2011 Notes</a></h1><time datetime=2011-11-19T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Sat, Nov 19, 2011</time><p><strong>PASS (Professional Association for SQL Server)</strong> is “an independent, user-led, not-for-profit organization co-founded by Microsoft and CA in 1999.
