PASS Summit is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest, most-focused, and most-intensive conference for Microsoft SQL Server and BI professionals.” (Source: the PASS website at &lt;a href="sqlpass.org">sqlpass.org&lt;/a>). The summit is held every year in Seattle. This year, the summit was held from October 11 to October 14 and focused on the upcoming RTM launch of SQL Server Denali, now re-branded as SQL Server 2012. The RTM will be released in the first half of 2012. Microsoft claims it is the biggest release of the SQL Server suite they have done so far with hundreds of enhancements. Some are general such as performance enhancements for the RDBMS as well as SSAS and SSIS. Another notable enhancement is that the cloud version of SQL Server (SQL Azure) is now built using the same codebase as the on-premise version. This write-up outlines some of the other enhancements that were highlighted at the summit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
