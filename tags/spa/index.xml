It is a simple list-maker application- nothing fancy. But I have been using it since I put it up and it has come in handy quite a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am quite impressed with .NET Core (or I should say &amp;ldquo;the new .NET&amp;rdquo; - to mean not just the .NET Core runtime, but .NET Standard, the new project system, ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and let&amp;rsquo;s say even the latest language improvements to C#). So much so, that it is going to suck a bit going back to writing traditional .NET Framework stuff for my day job.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The New Way Forward for SPAs with Angular and React</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-new-way-forward-for-spas-with-angular-and-react/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/the-new-way-forward-for-spas-with-angular-and-react/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having worked with &lt;em>Angular 1.x&lt;/em> for some time and having liked it quite a lot (I guess that one we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to call &lt;strong>AngularJS&lt;/strong>, and the new one is just &lt;strong>Angular&lt;/strong> - yes, that is not confusing at all, is it?), I must say I was quite spooked when I first saw the documentation for the new &lt;a href="https://angular.io/">Angular&lt;/a>. It indeed is a completely different framework. There is no easy migration path from AngularJS short of a rewrite, at which point you might as well evaluate all your options including React.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
