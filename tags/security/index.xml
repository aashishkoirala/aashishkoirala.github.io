I kept running into rumblings on the internet about how even though it was widely adopted, OAuth2/OpenID Connect were somehow less secure. Comparing a secure implementation of both side by side, I did not really see how this could be. Since our industry is not short on oversimplification and grand proclamations, I decided to pose this question to experts in the field.</description></item><item><title>Writing a WS-Federation Based STS using WIF</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/writing-a-ws-federation-based-sts-using-wif/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/writing-a-ws-federation-based-sts-using-wif/</guid><description>Even though SAML and WS-* have started to be looked upon as the old guard of security protocols with the popularity of OAuth 2, they are not without their merits. For one, they are inherently more secure than OAuth (in fact, you need to rely on a separate underlying secure transport for OAuth to be considered secure- and if you are someone who believes SSL is broken, then OAuth is practically insecure).</description></item></channel></rss>
