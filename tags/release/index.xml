It was quite easy. Setting up the build pipeline is as simple as including a YAML file in your source repository. It then just comes down to knowing &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=vsts&amp;amp;tabs=schema">how the build YAML schema works&lt;/a>. As far as the release (or deployment) pipeline is concerned, though, I could not find a similar method. I had to set it up through the Azure DevOps UI. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there is some information I am missing, but that would seem to somewhat go against the DevOps principle - you know - &lt;em>infrastructure as code&lt;/em> and all.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
