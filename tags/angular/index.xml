It indeed is a completely different framework. There is no easy migration path from AngularJS short of a rewrite, at which point you might as well evaluate all your options including React.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bootstrap Modal With AngularJS</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/bootstrap-modal-with-angularjs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/bootstrap-modal-with-angularjs/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll look at a relatively low hanging fruit in case you&amp;rsquo;re working with vanilla AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and are not relying on other add-ons such as AngularUI&amp;rsquo;s Bootstrap extension. One common need I have is to be able to show or hide Bootstrap modals based on a property on my view-model. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified view of the controller:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>var app = angular.module('app', ...);
...

app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, ...) {
	...
	$scope.showModal = false;
	...
});
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And here is the HTML:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conditional JQuery Datepicker With AngularJS</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/conditional-jquery-datepicker-with-angularjs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/conditional-jquery-datepicker-with-angularjs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just find AngularJS directives so much fun. It is so satisfying to see them work. Recently, I came across a requirement where I had a text field bound to a property that could either be a date or text. I had a way of knowing which one it was, but if the property was a date, the text field would need to become a datepicker, and turn back into a normal text field if not. And no, not an HTML5 date control - an old-timy jQuery datepicker.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TypeScript, AngularJS and Bootstrap- The Killer Combo</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/typescript-angularjs-and-bootstrap-the-killer-combo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/typescript-angularjs-and-bootstrap-the-killer-combo/</guid><description>&lt;p>After having recently used this combination, I am in love with it. For those unfamiliar with any of these, here are quick one liners:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/">TypeScript&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is a JavaScript superset from &lt;strong>Microsoft&lt;/strong> that compiles down to JavaScript and adds static typing and other neat features like classes and what not. It is worth mentioning that none other than &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (the father of C#) was involved in its development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is a JavaScript framework geared towards building rich and testable single-page applications. This one comes from none other than &lt;strong>Google&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
