But if you need more control, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get familiar with &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">Media Queries&lt;/a> in CSS. It might come in handy some time, plus that is what Bootstrap uses under the hood as well, and it never hurts to learn how the tools you use work.

CSS3 is obviously quite powerful and media queries provide a relatively easy way to build one unified UI that looks great on PCs, but then adapts and shape-shifts accordingly when viewed on a smartphone or tablet without having to completely re-implement a &amp;ldquo;mobile site&amp;rdquo; as so many do today. Since UI design is not my core area, though, I never could quite gather the energy to do something with it. Then I saw support for responsiveness in the new &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities">Bootstrap 3&lt;/a>. Like with all other aspects of web UI design, it makes responsiveness that much easier as well. As added motivation, I tried out my &lt;a href="https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/yes-one-more-to-do-application/">To Do&lt;/a> application in my smartphone - and it looked awful.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
