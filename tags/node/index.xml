I thought it would be a good idea to put it out there in case someone is starting out with Node, should they stumble on here. So, here it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To quote &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs">Wikipedia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A software system designed for writing scalable internet applications, notably web servers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Programs are written in JavaScript, using event-driven, asynchronous I/O to minimize overhead and maximize scalability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consists of Google&amp;rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine plus several built-in libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created by Ryan Dahl starting in 2009; growth sponsored by Joyent, his employer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The V8 JavaScript Engine is part of why Chrome is so fast. It compiles JavaScript to native code. It has a &amp;ldquo;stop-the-world&amp;rdquo; garbage collector that makes it more suitable for non-interactive applications. In Dahl&amp;rsquo;s words, V8 is a &amp;ldquo;beast&amp;rdquo; with all sorts of features (such as debugging). Node.js is a JavaScript library (compare to JRE or .NET framework) on top of the V8 JS Engine (compare to JVM or .NET CLR).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
