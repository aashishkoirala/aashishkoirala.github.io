It has been around for a while and has been continually improving. The purpose-built simplicity and extra focus on making concurrency easy and safe is part of it. The other part I like is the ease with which what you write becomes portable. These aspects especially make it a good fit to write infrastructure and tooling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working with Windows Containers in Kubernetes</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/working-with-windows-containers-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/working-with-windows-containers-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even though &lt;strong>Docker&lt;/strong> was built atop Linux containers and that is the majority of Docker usage out there, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/">Windows Containers&lt;/a> have been a thing for a while now. They went mainstream in 2016, and one hopes &amp;ldquo;ready for primetime&amp;rdquo; with Windows Server 2019. Even though integration with Docker is getting tighter, if you are in the unfortunate position of having to use Windows Containers with &lt;strong>Kubernetes&lt;/strong>, you are going to have issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing PFX Certificates in Docker Containers</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/installing-pfx-certificates-in-docker-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/installing-pfx-certificates-in-docker-containers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I came across having to install PKCS12 certificate bundles (i.e. a PFX file with the certificate and private key included, protected with a password) on a &lt;strong>Docker&lt;/strong> container. This is standard fare on normal Windows machines or on PaaS systems such as Azure App Service. Doing this on a container, though, proved to be tricky (perhaps with good reason as I mention later) - so tricky that I ended up writing &lt;a href="https://pfxtool.aashishkoirala.com">my own tool&lt;/a> to do it. I have written this up in case you have similar needs and are working with &lt;strong>.NET Core&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running .NET Core Global Tools Without the SDK</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/running-dotnet-core-global-tools-without-the-sdk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/running-dotnet-core-global-tools-without-the-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools">.NET Core Global Tools&lt;/a> are pretty neat. If you are targetting developers with the .NET Core SDK installed on their machines and need to ship CLI tools, your job is made immensely easier. It is just as easy as shipping a NuGet package. However, once you get used to building these things, it is easy to fall into the trap of treating this shipping mechanism as if it were &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey&lt;/a> (or &lt;em>apt-get&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>yum&lt;/em>, or what-have-you). It is certainly not that. The process of installing and upgrading your tools are handled by the .NET Core SDK - which alleviates you from having to create a self-contained package if you were shipping a ready-to-go tool - and this makes sense - global tools are a developer-targetted thing. You&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to use it to distribute end-user applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Service Fabric, Kubernetes and Docker</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/on-service-fabric-kubernetes-and-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/on-service-fabric-kubernetes-and-docker/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE (Nov 13, 2019)&lt;/strong> My views on this have changed since I wrote this post. See &lt;a href="https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/revisiting-kubernetes-vs-service-fabric/">this post&lt;/a> for where I stand now.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Let us get &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker&lt;/a> out of the way first. Microservices and containers are quite the hype these days. With hype comes misinformation and hysteria. A lot of people conflate the two (fortunately there are &lt;a href="https://jimmybogard.com/my-microservices-faq/">wise people out there&lt;/a> to set us all straight). If you have done your due diligence and decided to go with microservices, you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to go with containers. In fact, one would argue that using containers for production might be a good crutch for applications that have too many tentacles and there is no appetite to port them or rewrite them to be &amp;ldquo;portable&amp;rdquo;. Containers do have &lt;a href="https://jimmybogard.com/containers-what-is-it-good-for/">other good use cases&lt;/a> too. Docker being the leading container format (although starting to face some competition from &lt;a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt&lt;/a> these days), all in all I am glad containers exist and I am glad that Docker exists. Just be aware of the fact that what you think you must use may not be what you need at all.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
