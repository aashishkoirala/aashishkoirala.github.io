But if you need more control, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get familiar with Media Queries in CSS. It might come in handy some time, plus that is what Bootstrap uses under the hood as well, and it never hurts to learn how the tools you use work. The Mozilla page on media queries goes into just the right amount of detail and gives you a good outline of everything you can do with it.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrap Modal With AngularJS</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/bootstrap-modal-with-angularjs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.com/blog/tech/bootstrap-modal-with-angularjs/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ll look at a relatively low hanging fruit in case you&amp;rsquo;re working with vanilla AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and are not relying on other add-ons such as AngularUI&amp;rsquo;s Bootstrap extension. One common need I have is to be able to show or hide Bootstrap modals based on a property on my view-model. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified view of the controller:

For those unfamiliar with any of these, here are quick one liners:
TypeScript is a JavaScript superset from Microsoft that compiles down to JavaScript and adds static typing and other neat features like classes and what not. It is worth mentioning that none other than Anders Hejlsberg (the father of C#) was involved in its development.
