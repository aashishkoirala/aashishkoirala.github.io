This is standard fare on normal Windows machines or on PaaS systems such as Azure App Service. Doing this on a container, though, proved to be tricky (perhaps with good reason as I mention later) - so tricky that I ended up writing &lt;a href="https://pfxtool.aashishkoirala.com">my own tool&lt;/a> to do it. I have written this up in case you have similar needs and are working with &lt;strong>.NET Core&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
