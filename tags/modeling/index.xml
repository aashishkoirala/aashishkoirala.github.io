The CodeDOM is a cool library within .NET that can be used for structured code generation and compilation. When combined with Reflection, one neat application is to be able to inject aspects into your code at run-time. I have created Aspects for .NET, a library that does just that, and also tries to bring AOP to MEF.
Whether it be generating boilerplate, generating proxy classes or processing DSL, code generation has numerous applications.</description></item><item><title>Modeling, DSL and T4- Ramblings</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.github.io/blog/tech/modeling-dsl-and-t4-ramblings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.github.io/blog/tech/modeling-dsl-and-t4-ramblings/</guid><description>UPDATE (2015/01/10)
There have been changes in my thoughts about how one should go about this. Consequently, I have abandoned the modeling library that I speak of in this blog post. Understandably, the link to which that points no longer works.
I absolutely loathe writing repetitive code. That is what machines are for. My philosophy therefore is to try to generate as much of these kinds of code as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
