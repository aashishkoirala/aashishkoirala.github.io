&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE (2015/01/10)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There have been changes in my thoughts about how one should go about this. Consequently, I have abandoned the modeling library that I speak of in this blog post. Understandably, the link to which that points no longer works.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I absolutely loathe writing repetitive code. That is what machines are for. My philosophy therefore is to try to generate as much of these kinds of code as possible. With .NET, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Template_Transformation_Toolkit">T4&lt;/a> gives you a pretty neat code generation mechanism for generating code that follows a given pattern (the first example that comes to mind are POCOs from a domain model). If you think about it though, most multi-tier enterprise type applications have quite a bit of code that can be generated and that derives from the original domain model. How nice would it be to be able to generate a huge chunk of the codebase so that you only have to think about, write and &lt;em>test&lt;/em> what you absolutely need to? I guess Entity Framework does some of it for you if you&amp;rsquo;re into it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like the heavy-handedness of it (like me), you could opt for keeping your model as an EDMX file but then writing a bunch of T4 around it to generate various layers of code based on it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
