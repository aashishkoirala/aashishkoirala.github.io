I am an introvert and love listening to classic metal and classic rock among other things. My interest in science and generally &ldquo;knowing stuff&rdquo; predates my interest in programming. Writing is a big passion, although I don&rsquo;t do enough of it. I am a perennial Seinfeld fan. I am not into sports. I love movies, TV and books. Cosmic horror in particular is a favorite genre. I like to think I am an appreciator of good scotch, good beer and good coffee. I am a big fan and proponent of remote work and all the good it brings.</p><p>I caught the programming bug when I was twelve, fiddling with QBASIC and MS-DOS batch scripts on a 80386 PC. A few years later I picked up VB. I must have written hundreds of applications in VB by the time I was in high school - varying in quality and usefulness, of course. Web design and HTML made their way in around this time and a short stint as a &ldquo;HTML web designer&rdquo; followed before college. Then came JavaScript. College and engineering brought a LOT of new stuff into the mix. I picked up C, C++, Java and SQL along the way, but I also started getting interested in the process of developing software, in software architecture, patterns, and how software development could be approached like an engineering discipline. I got into Linux, into networking and protocols, and into security. My main passion remained development, however.</p><p>I speed-taught myself .NET and C# in order to land my first serious programming job. It remains my primary language and tech stack to this day, especially because of &ldquo;the new modern .NET&rdquo;. I am very much into Linux and Bash as well. I pretty much live in the terminal (WSL2 on Windows FTW). My recent work is very cloud-focused, both on AWS and Azure, and a lot of Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and serverless and asynchronous event-driven stuff. I&rsquo;ve also personally been doing a lot of coding with TypeScript, while dabbling in Go.</p><p>Lastly, I believe in compassion before judgement, and would like to think I practice it as much as possible.</p><p>I am on <a href=https://github.com/aashishkoirala>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://linkedin.com/in/aashishkoirala/>LinkedIn</a>.
