<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aashish Koirala. I write code. I think a lot, and I write about some of it. Born and raised in majestic Kathmandu, Nepal, I now live in the beautiful state of Massachusetts, USA with my wife and toddler daughter where I build software for a living.</p>
<p>I caught the programming bug when I was twelve, fiddling with QBASIC and MS-DOS batch scripts on a 80386 PC. A few years later I picked up VB. I must have written hundreds of applications in VB by the time I was in high school - varying in quality and usefulness, of course. Web design and HTML made their way in around this time and a short stint as a &ldquo;HTML web designer&rdquo; followed before college. Then came JavaScript. College and engineering brought a LOT of new stuff into the mix. I picked up C, C++, Java and SQL along the way, but I also started getting interested in the process of developing software, in software architecture, patterns, and how software development could be approached like an engineering discipline. I got into Linux, into networking and protocols, and into security. My main passion remained development, however.</p>
<p>I speed-taught myself .NET and C# in order to land my first serious programming job. Almost a decade and a half later, with the state of the C# language (which is rapidly ever evolving still), with .NET Core, with Azure and with where Microsoft is today in terms of technology, openness and community, I am extremely glad I chose .NET as my primary platform. Then there&rsquo;s JavaScript - which, of course, is impossible to stay away from if you do what I do. Microsoft opening up and embracing Linux and other platforms in recent years has been exciting and encouraging to see, as has the emergence of containers, Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>I am an introvert and a perennial Seinfeld fan. My interest in science and generally &ldquo;knowing stuff&rdquo; predates my interest in programming. I love food and I am not athletic, but I try to keep fit. Writing is a big passion, although I don&rsquo;t do enough of it. The hope is still to be a published author at some point (we can all dream). I love listening to classic rock and classic metal. I used to play the drums a little bit but never got quite good at it. My other dream is to be able to play at least one musical instrument well enough. I would like to think there is still hope.</p>
<p>The <a href=/>main page</a> has all the relevant links you need to get to me. The best way to get to me for technical stuff or about anything on this website is through <a href=https://twitter.com/aashishkoirala/>Twitter</a>, preferably via DM. Professional inquiries can use <a href=https://linkedin.com/in/aashishkoirala/>LinkedIn</a>, or my <a href=/resume>resume here</a>. If you know me personally and would like to connect, I can be found on Facebook, even though I don&rsquo;t use it as much.</p>
