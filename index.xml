You can write a simple Main() method and do your stuff, but how do you get the advantage of the amazing configuration and dependency injection that you get out of the box with hosted apps?</description></item><item><title>An AWS Primer for Azure Developers</title><link>https://aashishkoirala.github.io/blog/tech/an-aws-primer-for-azure-developers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aashishkoirala.github.io/blog/tech/an-aws-primer-for-azure-developers/</guid><description>Even though AWS has been around for much longer, as is the norm for a lot of people coming from the .NET/Microsoft side of things, my cloud experience started with Azure. I got into AWS when I was a few years into Azure.

I write code. I think a lot, and I write about some of it. Born and raised in majestic Kathmandu, Nepal, I now live in the beautiful state of Massachusetts, USA with my wife and toddler daughter where I build software for a living.
I caught the programming bug when I was twelve, fiddling with QBASIC and MS-DOS batch scripts on a 80386 PC. A few years later I picked up VB.</description></item></channel></rss>
